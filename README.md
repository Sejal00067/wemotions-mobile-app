# WeMotions

To build and run the app on your device, do the following:

-   [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/) by following the instructions on their website.
-   Fork/clone this repo to your computer using 

```bash
https://github.com/FlicLabs/wemotions-mobile.git
```

- Use Flutter **FVM** to setup project.
- Connect your devices/emulators and run the app using `flutter run` in the root of the project directory.


## Flutter Assignment: Implement 4D Scrolling

### Objective

Enhance the Wemotions mobile app by implementing a dynamic 4D scrolling experience that enables users to seamlessly browse video feeds and their video replies. The goal is to create an immersive and smooth scrolling interface where users can easily navigate through videos and their corresponding video replies.

### Tasks

#### 1. API Integration

- Use the following endpoints:

Fetch the list of main video feed. 
```bash 
https://api.wemotions.app/feed?page=1&page_size=5
```  
Fetch video replies linked to a specific video. 
```bash
https://api.wemotions.app/posts/{id}/replies?page=1&page_size=5
```

## Requirements:

  - Dynamically display video feeds from the API.
  - Implement lazy loading for video feeds and replies to optimize data usage and performance.

#### 2. 4D Scrolling Implementation

- Create a smooth, immersive 4D scrolling experience:

  - **Vertical Scrolling:** Navigate through the list of main video feed. 
  - **Nested Scrolling:** Allow vertical or horizontal scrolling through video replies under each main video.
  - **Video Interactivity:** Enable play/pause functionality for videos during scrolling and user interaction.

#### 3. Performance Optimization

- Ensure efficient rendering of both video feeds and replies to prevent lag or stutters.
- Apply lazy loading techniques to fetch video data only when necessary, reducing memory usage and network overhead.

#### 4. UI/UX Consistency

- Align all video elements with the app‚Äôs existing design and visual style.
- Clearly distinguish main videos from their replies and enable smooth transitions between them.

#### 5. Error Handling

- Gracefully handle API failures or cases where no video replies are available.
- Provide appropriate fallback UI or messages in such scenarios.

### 6. Dot (.) Indicators ‚Äî What Do They Mean?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c86513a-9bfc-4650-9efe-ec96eec74952)


Each dot represents a **page of videos or replies** ‚Äî think of them as ‚Äúbatches‚Äù of 5 videos each.

- The letter **‚ÄúH‚Äù** means **Home** pointing the **main parent at home feed**.
- The letter **‚ÄúP‚Äù** means **Parent** or the **parent video of current replies**.
- The **number inside the dots** shows how many more videos or replies are left to load beyond what you see now.
- A **filled dot** shows the **current video** being viewed.
- These dots help users see how much content there is and track where they are while browsing.

## Final Output 
- Final output should look simillar as shown in the video.
