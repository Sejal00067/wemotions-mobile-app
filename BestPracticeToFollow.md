# Best Practice to Follow

When building WeMotions, adopting a feature-first structure, using Provider for state management, and following a clean and modular approach ensures the app remains organized, scalable, and maintainable as it grows.

## Feature-First Structure

Organize your project around features. Each feature should have its own folder, containing the necessary layers: presentation, application, and data. This approach keeps everything related to a specific feature in one place, making it easier to add, update, or remove features without impacting other parts of the app.

For example, the “Home” feature, which contains the feed, would have all its files—UI components, state management logic, business rules, and API interactions—contained within a single folder. This makes it straightforward to focus on individual features while maintaining consistency across the codebase.

### Key Benefits:
- **Modularity:** Features are self-contained, reducing dependency conflicts.
- **Scalability:** Adding new features is easier without bloating unrelated parts.
- **Collaboration:** Team members can work on different features independently.

## Provider for State Management

Each feature should have its own Provider, like HomeProvider or VideoFeedProvider, to encapsulate the state and logic specific to that feature. Providers serve as the bridge between the UI and the application/data layers, ensuring state is managed reactively.

### Provider Best Practices:
- Keep Providers focused on state management and interaction with application/data layers.
- Use ChangeNotifier to expose states and trigger UI updates efficiently.
- Delegate heavy logic, such as data fetching or transformations, to services within the feature.

### Scoped State:
- **Feature-Level Providers:** Localized to the feature for modular state handling.
- **Global Providers:** Only for shared app-wide states, injected via MultiProvider.

This approach ensures self-contained state management, making debugging and feature updates easier while reducing unintended side effects across the app.

## Feature Layers

To ensure separation of concerns and maintainability, structure each feature into three distinct layers:

### 1. Presentation Layer:
- Contains UI components like screens and widgets.
- Consumes Providers for state and data binding.

### 2. Application Layer:
- Handles feature-specific business logic and workflows.
- Includes services that fetch data from APIs and process user actions.

### 3. Data Layer:
- Interacts directly with APIs to fetch and return data.
- Services abstract API interactions and act as the only source of truth for the application layer.

## Implementation Guidelines
- **Feature-Centric Design:** Focus on functional features (e.g., “Video Feed” or “Motions & Voting”), not just UI screens.
- **Shared Code:**
  - Keep shared utilities, constants, and reusable components in centralized folders (e.g., `common/`).
  - Avoid creating shared folders unless the code is genuinely reusable across features.
- **Provider Usage:** Use Providers to manage feature-specific state, exposing only what the UI needs.
- **Clear Layer Boundaries:**
  - Ensure each layer is responsible only for its specific task.
  - Avoid mixing responsibilities between layers to keep the codebase clean and testable.

## Example Workflow

For a “Home” feature:

### 1. Presentation Layer:
- A FeedScreen widget uses VideoFeedProvider to display a list of videos.

### 2. Application Layer:
- A FeedService fetches video data and processes user actions (e.g., like a video).

### 3. Data Layer:
- The FeedService interacts directly with an API client to retrieve the video data.

## Updated Best Practices
1. Organize by Features, Not Layers: Group everything related to a feature in one folder for modularity and maintainability.
2. Use Localized Providers: Keep Providers specific to features unless state is truly shared across the app.
3. Delegate Heavy Logic: Move complex operations out of Providers and into services.
4. Avoid Unnecessary Layers: Interact directly with services for data access without adding unnecessary abstraction.
5. Enforce Layer Separation: Clearly define roles for presentation, application, and data layers to keep the codebase modular and testable.

By following this updated structure and methodology, WeMotions will have a robust, organized, and scalable architecture that supports efficient development and long-term growth while keeping the implementation simple and focused.
